‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: WalletGen is a research and educational tool. It is not intended for unauthorized access or malicious activity. Use it responsibly and only with wallets you own or have permission to access.

## How It Works

WalletGen generates wallets, including Ethereum wallets, using the [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki) standard, and the [Keccak256](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html) hashing algorithm for EVM-based chains such as Ethereum.

The software checks generated Ethereum addresses against known address databases or checks balances in real-time via public blockchain explorers. This systematic approach allows for the identification of potentially valuable wallets.

Wallet Gen is built in C++ and open-source, offering transparency and community collaboration. Wallet Gen is designed for faster wallet generation compared to Python-based alternatives, taking advantage of your CPU & GPU.

##  Why WalletGen?

If you're looking for an efficient **Ethereum brute force** tool, choose **WalletGen**. Written in C++ and optimized for multi-threaded CPU and GPU usage, it provides performance that is up to **10x faster** than many similar tools. Whether you‚Äôre exploring lost wallets, validating key spaces, or working to recover your own, WalletGen delivers the speed and reliability you need.

## Features

-   **Ethereum Wallet Generation:** Supports creating Ethereum wallets.
-   **Brute-Force Search:** Use brute-force techniques to find existing wallets with balances on the Ethereum network.
-   **Algorithm Support:** Designed for EVM wallets with Keccak256 algorithm.
-   **Database Integration:** Download and use databases to improve search speed.

## How to Search for Lost Bitcoin & Ethereum Wallets with Balance

**Wallet Gen** allows you to use brute-force methods for finding crypto wallets with balances.

### For Bitcoin (BTC) wallets:

*   Select option 3 in the menu or run start_search_btc.bat to search Bitcoin wallets via the internet. This will take longer, as it uses real-time balance checks.
*   Select option 6 to search Bitcoin wallets using the database.  This offers a faster method by comparing generated wallets against a pre-existing database of known addresses.

### For EVM wallets (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

*   Select option 5 or run start_search_evm.bat to search for EVM wallets via the internet. This will check balances in real-time.
*   Select option 6 to search EVM wallets using the database. This is the faster approach, comparing generated wallets against a database of addresses known to hold balances.

### Speed Considerations:

*   The speed of the search depends on your hardware, particularly the GPU. To maximize speed, run multiple program instances (1 to 4).

## The Program Found a Wallet ‚Äî What‚Äôs Next?

When the program finds a wallet with a balance:
*   The search stops immediately.
*   Wallet details are shown in the console.
*   This data is saved in the ``found_wallets.txt`` file.

### How to Access the Funds?
1.  Import the **mnemonic seed phrase** from the located wallet into a compatible crypto wallet.
2.  You can then transfer the funds to your own wallet.

## Recovery Your Bitcoin Wallet

WalletGen can recover your Bitcoin wallet using the seed phrase (mnemonic phrase). The program supports entering a complete seed phrase, as well as searching for missing words.

### Process Description

#### Search for missing words:

If your seed phrase is incomplete, use * as a placeholder.

#### Entering a complete seed-phrase:

Enter the full 12-word seed.

### Important recommendations

*   Seed-phrase must contain exactly 12 words.
*   Use only the * symbol to search for missing words.
*   Searching for missing words may take time.
*   Successful recovery stops the program and saves data.

## My Finds

![mywallet](/default/slate.webp)

I‚Äôve recovered two BTC wallets with a balance. The first had 0.000032 BTC, the second contained 0.0528 BTC (roughly $4800 at the time of discovery).
Here‚Äôs the link to the wallet: [bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay](https://mempool.space/address/bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay).

### New Find 4/9/2025

After a week of non-stop wallet searching, I finally found a [wallet](https://mempool.space/address/bc1q29c5m3w4jxtsj4vcd2ccw4t68xm8m7vs5vytu0) with 0.25 bitcoin ($19k). This is my 4th and biggest find of all time.
